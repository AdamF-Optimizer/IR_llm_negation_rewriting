Ryan's former CIA superior, Vice Admiral James Greer, asks Ryan to rejoin the agency to help capture the terrorists. While investigating, Ryan recalls glimpsing a red-headed woman during the attacks on him and Lord Holmes. Ryan approaches Sinn Fein representative Paddy O'Neil for information. O'Neil denies IRA involvement and denounces the attacks, but refuses to betray any fellow Irishmen. Ryan threatens to sabotage O'Neil's American fundraising efforts by showing images of his hospitalized daughter to the media. O'Neil eventually relents and identifies the red-haired female accomplice as an Englishwoman (Annette). Finding her will lead to Miller. Satellite analysis indicates that Miller and O'Donnell are at a terrorist training camp in Libya. The Special Air Service raid the camp, killing everyone, though Miller, O'Donnell, and their cohorts have already fled to North America to coincide with Lord Holmes's visit there."

Lucien excuses himself from her company and, in a dramatic scene, indulges in her luxurious bathtub and emerges and boldly pursues an affair with the singer, who is in the midst of divorce. After some time her problems with her husband subside and the two make amends, and Lucien is driven mad, proclaiming, \"If you do not love me, I love you. And if I love you beware\". Lucien then contrives her murder and frames her husband successfully, and disappears shortly after to live as a carnie. There he falls in platonic love with the carnival director's pre-pubescent daughter which arouses the suspicion of paedophilic motivations by the director, who forbids his daughter to see or perform with L'Hotte."

Although generally true to the tone and story of James's work, the film is set in the 1920s—in contrast to the original 1840s setting—and accentuates sexual elements that some theorists have identified in the novella. The film's story is told in flashbacks during consultations between the institutionalised Ann (Michelle Dockery) and Dr Fisher (Dan Stevens). Ann tells how she was hired by an aristocrat (Mark Umbers) to care for the orphans Miles (Josef Lindsay) and Flora (Eva Sayer). She is met at the children's home, Bly, by Mrs Grose (Sue Johnston), the housekeeper. Ann soon begins to see unknown figures around the manor, and seeks an explanation."

With the help of a fellow soldier Huan (Ben Rindner) he starts translating the diary, which belonged to Dang Thuy Tram (Minh Houng), a doctor who was positioned at the field hospital for several years. She describes in vivid detail the horrors she experienced during the war: her friends die around her every day, food is scarce, and she misses her family. As Fred continues to read about the horrific fate of the wounded soldiers Thuy treated, he starts to see the humanity of his enemy and starts to have nightmares of the people he and the US army have killed. Once Fred returns to the United States, his translation efforts continue with the help of his brother Robert Whitehurst’s (Brian Townes) Vietnamese wife Mai (Tina Duong). While the family’s long history of military service in the US army initially clashes with the empathetic writing of their supposed enemy, they eventually grow to be inspired by Thuy’s altruism. 35 years pass before Fred brings the diary to Texas Tech University for a seminar on the Vietnam war. There the diary is archived digitally and eventually returned to Thuy’s surviving family."

These robots have two unchangeable protocols: they cannot harm any form of life and may not repair, modify, or alter themselves or other robots in any way. Initially seen as mankind's salvation, they are relegated to manual labor when they fail to stop the advance of desertification.

The film features the series' two lead heroes traveling back in time due to the machinations of an evil monster. The film was released nationally in Japan on December 12, 2015.\nThree months after the Roidmude threat has ended and the Drive arsenal sealed away, having brought a wedding ring to propose to Kiriko with, Shinosuke Tomari attempts to move on with his life when he is \"arrested\" by Kiriko and taken to Otta's office. Shinosuke agrees in taking a special assignment to investigate a series of paranormal crimes that have Akari Tsukimura and Onari present at each scene. Reaching Daitenkū-ji Temple, Shinosuke and Kiriko interview Onari and Akari as they explain they are Ghost Hunters with the latter having a scientific means to confirm their existence. However, the Gamma Superior behind the thefts steals the Musashi Ghost Eyecon and a furious Takeru Tenkūji transforms into Kamen Rider Ghost to attack the ghost. With Kiriko assuming Takeru to be the culprit as neither she nor Shinosuke can see the Ganma, the misunderstanding worsens when Kamen Riders Mach and Specter join the fray while the former gives Shinosuke a Mach Driver Honoh and the Dead Heat Shift Car to fight as Kamen Rider Deadheat Drive. Luckily, Akari uses the Shiranui to expose the Gamma who is quickly destroyed by the Kamen Riders with Ghost reclaiming his Eyecon. Following Takeru explaining himself to Shinosuke, a tremor occurs that causes a wormhole to appear on the monolith. Takeru sees an image of his father Ryū Tenkūji before he and Shinosuke are sucked in with the Condor Denwor."

It was written by Luke Dawson and is a remake on the 2004 Thai film of the same name. Its story follows newlywed couple Ben and Jane who have just moved to Japan for a promising job opportunity. After a tragic car accident that leads to the death of a young girl, Ben begins noticing strange blurs in many of his fashion shoot photographs, which Jane suspects is the spirit of the dead girl that they killed. The film stars Joshua Jackson, Rachael Taylor, and Megumi Okina.\n\n\nIt was produced by Regency Enterprises and was released on March 21, 2008. It grossed $10.4 million in its opening weekend and $48.6 million worldwide, against an $8 million budget, making the film a box office success despite having only a 9% approval rating based on 65 votes on Rotten Tomatoes.\nBen Shaw and his new wife Jane leave New York for Tokyo, Japan, where Ben has a job as a photographer. While traveling, Jane hits a girl in the middle of the wilderness. Because of this, they later start to find mysterious lights in their photos. Ben begins to complain of severe shoulder pain, and his friends begin to comment he's looking bent and hunched over, though the doctor he goes to see can find no cause. Ben's assistant takes them to her ex-boyfriend, who says that the lights are spirits, manifestations of intense emotions. They then go to a psychic, Murasame; however, Ben refuses to translate what Murasame says, claiming he is a hack.\n\n\nLater on Jane decides to visit the office building in the photo. When she gets there, she goes to the floor where the light has gathered, and takes pictures in the empty office. She encounters the spirit, and learns that the girl's name was Megumi Tanaka and that Ben knew her. When she confronts Ben about it, he admits that he and Megumi were once involved in a relationship, but that after the death of her father, she became very obsessive and clingy, and eventually dumped her, with help from his two friends. Jane is upset with Ben and decides they need to find Megumi."

The screenplay was written by William Nicholson. The film was released on 10 September 1999 in Spain and 15 February 2000 in US. It was the last film made by Largo Entertainment before it went defunct in 1999.\nArchibald Belaney (Brosnan) was a British man who grew up fascinated with Native American culture—so much so that in the early 1900s he left the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland for Canada, where he reinvented himself as Archie Grey Owl and pretended to be a Native American who was a trapper. Eventually, Belaney becomes an environmentalist after renouncing trapping and hunting.\n* Pierce Brosnan as Archibald \"Grey Owl\" Belaney"

The film recounts the 1952 expedition, initially by motorcycle, across South America by Guevara and his friend Alberto Granado. As well as being a road movie, the film is a coming-of-age film; as the adventure, initially centered on youthful hedonism, unfolds, Guevara discovers himself transformed by his observations on the life of the impoverished indigenous peasantry. Through the characters they encounter on their continental trek, Guevara and Granado witness first hand the injustices that the destitute face and are exposed to people and social classes they would have never encountered otherwise. To their surprise, the road presents to them both a genuine and captivating picture of Latin American identity. As a result, the trip also plants the initial seed of cognitive dissonance and radicalization within Guevara, who would later view armed revolution as a way to challenge the continent's endemic economic inequalities and political repression."

Schaffner with a screenplay by Gore Vidal based on his 1960 play of the same title. Starring Henry Fonda, Cliff Robertson, and Lee Tracy, the film details the seamy political maneuverings behind the nomination of a presidential candidate. The supporting cast features Edie Adams, Margaret Leighton, Ann Sothern, Shelley Berman, Gene Raymond and Kevin McCarthy. Lee Tracy was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance and it was his final film.\nIn May 1964, former Secretary of State William Russell (Henry Fonda) and Senator Joe Cantwell (Cliff Robertson) are the two leading candidates for the presidential nomination of the Democratic Party. Both have potentially fatal vulnerabilities. Russell is a principled intellectual but his sexual indiscretions and lack of attention to his wife Alice (Margaret Leighton) have alienated her. He has a past nervous breakdown to live down. Cantwell portrays himself as a populist \"man of the people\" and patriotic anti-communist campaigning to end \"the missile gap\". He is a ruthless opportunist, willing to go to any lengths to get the nomination. Neither man can stand the other; neither believes his rival qualified to be president. At the nominating convention in Los Angeles, they lobby for the crucial support of dying former President Art Hockstader (Tracy). The pragmatic Hockstader prefers Russell, but worries about his indecision and principles; he despises Cantwell for his recklessness but appreciates his toughness and willingness to do whatever it takes.\n\n\nHockstader decides to support Cantwell until the candidate blunders badly. When the two speak privately, Cantwell attacks Russell using illegally obtained psychological reports obtained by Don Cantwell, his brother and campaign manager. Cantwell mistakenly assumed that Hockstader was going to endorse Russell. The former President tells Cantwell that he does not mind a \"bastard\" but objects to a stupid one. He endorses neither man. The candidates try to sway undecided delegates, Russell appealing to their principles and Cantwell using blackmail. Russell finds out to his chagrin that Hockstader has offered the vice-presidential spot on his ticket to all three of the minor candidates, Senator Oscar Anderson (Richard Arlen), Governor John Merwin (William R. Ebersol) and Governor T.T. Claypoole (John Henry Faulk). One of Russell's aides finds Sheldon Bascomb (Shelley Berman), who served in the military with Cantwell and is willing to link him to homosexual activity while stationed in Alaska during World War II. Hockstader and Russell's closest advisors press Russell to seize the opportunity but he refuses to do so."

It is a remake of Yōjirō Takita's ''Himitsu'', a 1999 Japanese film produced by Yasuhiro Mase, written by Hiroshi Saitô.\nHannah (Lili Taylor) is fatally injured in a car accident; and her spirit migrates into the body of her unconscious daughter Samantha (Olivia Thirlby) when Hannah dies on a gurney next to her. Hannah resolves to keep her daughter's life running smoothly in preparation for her potential return. Hannah, living in Samantha's body, endeavors to keep up an emotional relationship with the husband/father, Ben (David Duchovny), which sometimes veers perilously close to becoming physical, to mutual horror. Her experience helps her to learn a lot about the previously unknown (to her) life her daughter was living and helps her to see how harrowing a teen's life can be in these times, as she struggles to walk the tightrope many teens must negotiate. She's confronted by conflicting pulls between the alluring attractions adolescents face every day and the demands of schoolwork that she finds largely unfamiliar to her, since a couple of decades have passed since her own graduation. As she discovers, Samantha's life has been a challenge to meet her parents' expectations for academic excellence and behavior in an acceptable range, all the while being overwhelmed by the hormones of adolescence, in many ways more powerful than any of the drugs the kids experiment with. It is at times difficult for her to keep that grip; but, for Ben, the possessiveness he feels toward his wife's soul in his daughter's body threatens to completely overwhelm his life as well as he"

Lambert plays Paul Racine, an American businessman who by accident earns the wrath of a ninja clan led by Lone's character, Kinjo.\n\n\nThe film was shot in Nagoya, Japan, and Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada on a $25 million budget, and premiered in February 1995, taking in $6.6 million in U.S. box office. Most critic reviews found the plot clichéed and the acting unconvincing, while some praised Harada's performance as samurai Ijuro Takeda, Racine's protector and Kinjo's sworn enemy. The critically well-received soundtrack featured music by the Japanese taiko troupe Kodō, which pervades the film."

Directed by Chad Stahelski, with a script co-written by Shay Hatten and Michael Finch, and based on characters created by Derek Kolstad, it is produced by Stahelski, Basil Iwanyk and Erica Lee. Starring Keanu Reeves returning as the title character, the film is produced by Thunder Road Pictures and 87North Productions.\n\n\nDistributed by Lionsgate, the film is set to be theatrically released in the United States on March 24, 2023. Originally set for release on May 21, 2021, the film was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and partially due to Reeves' commitments with ''The Matrix Resurrections''.\n* Keanu Reeves as John Wick, a professional hitman and assassin who has gained legendary reputation for his set of skills and is now hunted by the High Table.\n* Laurence Fishburne as The Bowery King\n* Ian McShane as Winston, the manager of the Continental Hotel\n* Lance Reddick as Charon, the concierge at the Continental Hotel in New York\n\n* Rina Sawayama as Akira\nAdditionally, Donnie Yen, Shamier Anderson, Bill Skarsgård, Hiroyuki Sanada, Scott Adkins, and Clancy Brown have been cast in undisclosed roles.\n\n===Development===\nOn May 20, 2019, following the release of ''Parabellum'', Lionsgate announced that a fourth movie is already in the works. Fans who had been receiving \"John Wick\" text updates from Lionsgate received the sequel news in assassin-speak Monday: \"You have served. You will be of service. ''John Wick: Chapter 4'' is coming – May 21, 2021\", announcing not only the film but its release date.\n\n\nBefore the third film's release, director Chad Stahelski confirmed on a Reddit \"AMA\" thread that there had been discussion for another film, and that he would be involved with the project should the threequel be successful. Despite this announcement back then, it was not confirmed if star Keanu Reeves would return for a new installment. However, he told ''GQ'' that he would carry on the role as long as the audience wanted it, saying, \"As far as my legs can take me, as far as the audience wants to go.\"\n\n\nStahelski later teased the fourth film on an interview with IndieWire by saying Wick would not end the fourth film in \"a happy ending\", saying, \"John may survive all this shit but at the end of it, there's no happy ending. He's got nowhere to go. Honestly, I challenge you right now, here's a question to you: How do you fucking want me to end it? Do you think he's going to ride off into the fucking sunset? He's killed 300 fucking people and he's just going to walk away, everything's okay? He's just going to fall in love with a love interest? If you're this fucking guy, if this guy really existed, how is this guy's day going to end? He's fucked for the rest of his life. It's just a matter of time.\" Additionally, Stahelski teased Winston's fate in the fourth film, saying, \"He meant to shoot him. Did he mean to kill him? That's open for interpretation, you can take it one of two ways, and that's kind of where we pick up some of the unanswered questions in ''John Wick 4''.\" The studio opted to move on from series creator Derek Kolstad and instead hired Shay Hatten to write the script in May 2020. In March 2021, screenwriting duties were passed onto ''Predators'' screenwriter Michael Finch.\n\n\nOn May 1, 2020, IndieWire revealed that the fourth film had been delayed to a May 2022 release date following the COVID-19 pandemic and Reeves' commitments to ''The Matrix Resurrections'', which was slated to be released on the same original date window with ''Wick 4''. \"''The Matrix 4'' was only four weeks in when this all happened production of ''The Matrix 4'' halted,\" Stahelski said, \"So, Keanu's gotta go finish his commitment up on ''The Matrix'', which is a big deal and which I think will probably take him until the end of the year. Then we have to go into our prep mode and then we'll start. So release dates ... who knows right now.\"\n\n\nWhen the fourth film was announced, Reeves was reportedly revealed to have begun his training course for ''John Wick 4'' and ''The Matrix 4''."

Filming for ''King Kong'' took place in New Zealand from September 2004 to March 2005. The project's budget climbed from an initial $150 million to a then-record-breaking $207 million."

Now mankind lives on Mars, in cities that resemble those once found on Earth, and are protected from the alien environment by dome-like force-fields. When a sandstorm of record intensity breaks through the dome and destroys Mars New York, those in Mars Los Angeles must figure out how to stop the storm before it wipes them out next. The sandstorm's power was heightened due to the terra-forming efforts on Mars reactivating long dormant volcanoes.\n\n\nDr. Foster is sent from Earth to Mars Los Angeles, \"MLA,\" to find a solution to stopping the storm from hitting the city, but is partnered with Neil, a pilot who is dating Foster's ex-wife Miranda.

The two escape and start to dance a romantic waltz in the stars. But soon the two lovers are discovered and as a last desperate act, hand-in-hand, they jump from the highest window in the tower. Jo Jo attempts to fly the two of them to safety, but Hero loses his grip and falls to the ground. Jo Jo is blown onto a window sill and re-captured by Madame Pica.

The film is Araki's eighth, premiering at the 61st Venice International Film Festival in 2004, although it was not more widely distributed until 2005.\n\n\n''Mysterious Skin'' tells the story of two pre-adolescent boys who both experienced a strange event as children, and how it affects their lives in different ways into their young adulthood. One boy becomes a reckless, sexually adventurous prostitute, while the other retreats into a reclusive fantasy of alien abduction.\nTwo eight-year-old Little League teammates, Neil McCormick and Brian Lackey, both experience life-altering events during the summer of 1981 in Hutchinson, Kansas. Neil, the son of an irresponsible single mother and already discovering his own homosexuality, is sexually abused by the Little League coach, who leaves town after that summer. Brian, whose parents are often neglectful or busy working, only remembers that it started to rain during a game. The next thing he remembers is being in the crawl space of his house with a bloody nose, having no memory of the intervening five hours."

This concept was previously explored with the 2000 direct-to-video film ''Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins'' which was the pilot to a spin-off television series, ''Buzz Lightyear of Star Command'' (2000–2001). The film was co-written and directed by Angus MacLane and stars Chris Evans as the voice of the title character, with Keke Palmer, Peter Sohn, James Brolin, Taika Waititi, Dale Soules, Uzo Aduba, Mary McDonald-Lewis, Efren Ramirez and Isiah Whitlock Jr. in supporting roles."

Murphy was due to return to the United States, but before doing so, she decided to record three interviews with former Literacy Campaign volunteers. From 2004 to 2010, Murphy continued to track down stories of Literacy Campaign volunteers and the families that hosted them, eventually producing and directing ''Maestra'' and founding The Literacy Project."

It was originally published as two separate stories serialized in different pulp magazines; \"Tarzan and the Magic Men\" in ''Argosy'' from September to October, 1936, and \"Tarzan and the Elephant Men\" in ''Blue Book'' from November 1937 to January 1938. The two stories were combined under the title ''Tarzan the Magnificent'' in the first book edition, published in 1939 by Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. In order of writing, the book follows ''Tarzan's Quest'' and precedes ''Tarzan and the Forbidden City''. In order of book publication it falls between the latter and ''Tarzan and the Foreign Legion''. The novel's plot bears no relation to that of the 1960 film of the same title."

Ai's mission is to persuade the nations of Gethen to join the Ekumen, but he is stymied by a lack of understanding of their culture. Individuals on Gethen are ''ambisexual'', with no fixed sex; this has a strong influence on the culture of the planet, and creates a barrier of understanding for Ai.\n\n\n''The Left Hand of Darkness'' was among the first books in the genre now known as feminist science fiction and is the most famous examination of androgyny in science fiction. A major theme of the novel is the effect of sex and gender on culture and society, explored in particular through the relationship between Ai and Estraven, a Gethenian politician who trusts and helps Ai. When the book was first published, the gender theme touched off a feminist debate over the depiction of the ambisexual Gethenians. The novel also explores the interaction between the unfolding loyalties of its two main characters, the loneliness and rootlessness of Ai, and the contrast between the religions of Gethen's two major nations."

Its author, arguing for both social autonomy and national sovereignty, supported the Greek struggle for national liberation and turned to the moral greatness of ancient Greece in order to stimulate collective pride. Although this work was widely read by Greeks before the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence in 1821, from its first appearance it was received with discomfort by its contemporary audience, and later generated scholarly debates on the identity of its author.\nThe origins of modern Greek republican thought can be traced in the works of Iosipos Moisiodax, a major representative of the modern Greek Enlightenment, especially in his work ''Apology'' (, 1780). Further development of republican thought in Greek culture was stimulated by French Revolutionary ideas."

The book examines the history of the relationship as well as its current trajectory. Its introduction begins with 'The China-Pakistan axis plays a central role in Asia's geopolitics, from India's rise to the prospects for a post-American Afghanistan, from the threat of nuclear terrorism to the continent's new map of mines, ports and pipelines. China is Pakistan's great economic hope and its most trusted military partner. It has been the subject of several articles and columns, including in ''The Economist'', the ''New York Times'', and the ''Financial Times''. The book is published by Hurst Publishers in the United Kingdom and Oxford University Press in the United States."

They have not been talking, their only form of communication being occasional notes on scraps of paper. However, they are soon to understand that they cannot live without each other.

They leave New York on Labor Day weekend to fetch their two children from summer camp in Maine. Many others parents are doing the same thing, and the roads are crowded. They hear on the radio that a prisoner, Sid Halligan, has escaped from Sing Sing. Steve and Nancy argue: she says he has drunk too much before they left. They stop at a bar and, to prevent Nancy driving on, he takes the car keys before going to the bar. He returns to find a note that she is going by coach."

Unfortunately, the dike trees are the favorite food of a species of pest-birds called ''nizzards''; the kingdom always faces the risk that the nizzards might compromise the dike-tree barrier and cause catastrophic flooding. The King's administration maintains a legion of Patrol Cats to keep the nizzards at bay; King Birtram sees to their care personally. When not attending to his royal duties, the King enjoys himself by frolicking in the streets on his red stilts, which most of his subjects note with amused acceptance."

The novel portrays a future totalitarian society apparently dominated by a matriarch, Nicole Thibodeaux. It revolves around the themes of reality and illusionary beliefs, as do many of Dick's works. Additionally, it touches on Nazi ideology.\nDick originally published the story as a novelette in the magazine ''Fantastic'', titled \"The Novelty Act\". He expanded the plot and titled the novel ''First Lady of Earth''. Before publication, the title was changed to ''The Simulacra''. The novel was originally published in 1964 as a paperback by Ace Books. It was one of four novels released by Dick that year.\nSet in the middle of the twenty-first century, after World War Three, ''The Simulacra'' is the story of several protagonists within the United States of Europe and America (USEA), formed by the merger of (West) Germany and the United States, where the whole government is a fraud and the President (''der Alte'', \"the Old Man\") is a simulacrum (android). Other global superpowers are the French Empire, People's Republic of China and Free (Black) Africa. The war may have involved tactical nuclear weapons. Poland has become the global focus of communist authority, with its administrative centre in Warsaw."

Homeless and destitute, he interprets everything he sees and experiences in 2011 from a Nazi perspective—for instance, he assumes that Turks in Germany are an indicator of Karl Dönitz having persuaded Turkey to join the Axis, and thinks that Wikipedia is named for ''Wikinger'' (\"Vikings\"). Although everyone recognizes him, nobody believes that he is Hitler; instead, they think he is either a comedian or a method actor. He appears on a variety television show called ''Whoa, dude!'', going off-script to broadcast his views. Videos of his angry rants become hugely successful on YouTube, and he achieves modern celebrity status as a performer. The newspaper ''Bild'' tries to take him down, but is sued into praising him. He is beaten up by Neo-Nazis who think he is mocking the memory of Hitler, unaware that he is the genuine article. In the end, he uses his popularity to re-enter politics."

The case of the Great Famine in the Soviet Union, known as Holodomor (meaning \"death by hunger\") belongs to the most extensive and heinous massacres known by the twentieth century, and it’s still unknown by many. It is an artificially induced famine during the years 1932 and 1933 by the Stalinist regime to the peoples of the Soviet Union as a result of the failure of forced collectivization. The Great Famine affected mainly the countries with large and fertile agricultural land, among which the Ukrainian case stands out, whose country, geographically, is the second largest in Europe and where it is estimated that the number of famine victims reached a dozen million\"."

(The page headers, however, continued to alternate between '''' and ''Eric''.)\nThe story is a parody of the tale of Faust, and follows the events of ''Sourcery'' in which the Wizard Rincewind was trapped in the Dungeon Dimensions. The Discworld version of Hell or Pandemonium exists simply because some people believe that it exists for them. In other Discworld stories, such as ''Small Gods'', the afterlife is different or non-existent, according to the various beliefs.\n\n\nRincewind wakes in a strange place, having been summoned to a house in Pseudopolis by the 13-year-old demonologist, Eric Thursley, who wants the mastery of all kingdoms, to meet the most beautiful woman who ever existed, and to live forever. He is disappointed when Rincewind tells him he is unable to deliver any of these things, and embarrassed when Rincewind sees through his disguise. Rincewind is disheartened to learn that the spells to confine the demon summoned are working on him; Eric's parrot tells him that because he was summoned as a demon, he is subject to the same terms."

He made up his mind to see rural conditions for himself, and to \"enforce by actual observation of rural conditions\" the statements he had made in answer to the arguments of the landlords before the Parliamentary Agricultural Committee.\n\n\nHe embarked on a series of journeys by horseback through the countryside of Southeast England and the English Midlands.
