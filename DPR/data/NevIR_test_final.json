Grissom crater is one of several located on the far side of the Moon named for Apollo astronauts. The name was created and used in jest by the Apollo 8 astronauts and was then used seriously, if unofficially, by NASA insiders until it adopted as the official name by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 1970. 2161 Grissom is a main belt asteroid that was discovered in 1963 and officially designated in 1981.

He published works of other black composers as well as his own, which included more than 150 sacred compositions and folk song arrangements and about 60 blues compositions. In the 1920s, he founded the Handy Record Company in New York City; while this label's records were respectably successful for their time, Handy was better remembered for the recording sessions he organized with it, because some of those recordings were eventually released on Paramount Records and Black Swan Records. So successful was \"Saint Louis Blues\" that in 1929 he and director Dudley Murphy collaborated on a RCA motion picture of the same name, which was to be shown before the main attraction. Handy suggested blues singer Bessie Smith for the starring role because the song had made her popular. The movie was filmed in June and was shown in movie houses throughout the United States from 1929 to 1932.",

At the same time, Peggy Caserta's memoir, \"Going Down With Janis\" (1973), attracted a lot of attention, with its provocative title referring to her performing oral sex with Joplin while they were high on heroin, in September 1970. The first sentence in the book goes into more detail about that particular encounter. Caserta's language and description repelled many people at a time when few books or filmed interviews of Joplin or her loved ones were accessible to the public. Peggy Caserta was described as \"halfway between a groupie and a friend\" in an interview that writer Ellis Amburn did with Joplin's bandmate Sam Andrew circa 1990 and published in 1992. Soon after the 1973 publication of \"Going Down With Janis\", Joplin's friends realized that graphic descriptions of sexual acts and intravenous drug use were the only portions of the book that would shock them, and that the book did not publish anything that they did not already know.",

Both the kingdom and duchy were dominated by a small number of major barons who owned lands on both sides of the English Channel, with the lesser barons beneath them usually having more localised holdings. The extent to which lands should be passed down through hereditary right or by the gift of the King was still uncertain (though the inheritance rules for positions had been settled), and tensions concerning this issue had grown during the reign of Henry I. Certainly lands in Normandy, passed by hereditary right, were usually considered more important to major barons than those in England, where their possession was less certain. Henry had increased the authority and capabilities of the central royal administration, often bringing in \"new men\" to fulfil key positions rather than using the established nobility. In the process he had been able to maximise revenues and contain expenditures, resulting in a healthy surplus and a famously large treasury, but also increasing political tensions.",

They are all tetrapods, so even the caecilians and the few species of salamander that appear to have no limbs do indeed, upon closer inspection, have limbs that are merely reduced in size. Their main bones are hollow and lightweight and are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other and have articular processes. Their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae. Their skulls are mostly broad and short, and are often incompletely ossified. Their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales, but contains many mucous glands and in some species, poison glands. The hearts of amphibians have three chambers, two atria and one ventricle. They have a urinary bladder and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as urea. Amphibians breathe by means of buccal pumping, a pump action in which air is first drawn into the buccopharyngeal region through the nostrils. These are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat. They supplement this with gas exchange through the skin which needs to be kept moist.",

By contrast, market socialism retains the use of monetary prices, factor markets and in some cases the profit motive, with respect to the operation of socially owned enterprises and the allocation of capital goods between them. Profits generated by these firms would be controlled directly by the workforce of each firm or accrue to society at large in the form of a social dividend. Anarchism, but not libertarian, socialism opposes the use of the state as a means to establish socialism, with anarchism favouring decentralisation above all, whether to establish non-market socialism or market socialism.",

While at Dartmouth, he was caught drinking gin with nine friends in his room. At the time, the consumption of alcohol was illegal under Prohibition laws, which remained in place between 1920 and 1933. As a result of this infraction, Dean Craven Laycock insisted that Geisel resign from all extracurricular activities, including the \"Jack-O-Lantern\". To continue working on the magazine without the administration's knowledge, Geisel began signing his work with the pen name \"Seuss\". He was encouraged in his writing by professor of rhetoric W.

The game is fast-paced, no standard notation exists, and players keep their initial setups secret, so recording games is impractical. However, digital interfaces such as web-based gaming interfaces, may have a facility for recording, replaying and downloading the game. Those interfaces use an algebraic-style notation that numbers the rows ('ranks') 1 to 10 from bottom to top and the columns ('files') A to J from left to right. Alternately, a few interfaces designate the files as A to K, omitting 'I'. Moves are recorded as source square followed by destination square separated by a \"-\" (move) or \"x\" (strike). Revealed pieces on strikes precede the square designation, and may be by either rank name or rank number for brevity, for example \"major B2xcaptain B3\". The bottom half of the board is by default considered to be the 'red' side, and the top half the 'blue' side.",

It was hoped that the new team would be supported by the many former Giant and Dodger fans left without a team when the franchises moved to California after the 1957 season. There were rumors through the 1961 season that Stengel would be the manager, and he initially showed interest in managing a team that, given the rules for the expansion draft, was unlikely to be competitive. George Weiss had been forced out as Yankee general manager and hired by the Mets. He wanted Stengel as manager, and after talks with the Mets principal owners, Joan Whitney Payson and M. Donald Grant, Stengel was introduced as Mets manager at a press conference on October 2, 1961. Leonard Koppett of \"The New York Times\" suggested that Stengel took the job to give something back to the game that had been his life for half a century.",

Henrietta had no biological children, but her organization Youth Aliyah rescued many Jewish children from Nazi Germany and provided for them. She also championed children's rights. Szold is considered the \"mother\" of all those children, and that is why her annual remembrance day (\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d4\u05e9\u05e0\u05d4) was set as Mother's Day (\u05d9\u05d5\u05b9\u05dd \u05d4\u05b8\u05d0\u05b5\u05dd, yom ha'em). The holiday has evolved over time, becoming a celebration of mutual love inside the family, called Family Day (\u05d9\u05d5\u05b9\u05dd \u05d4\u05b7\u05de\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05bc\u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05d7\u05b8\u05d4, yom hamishpacha). This holiday is mainly celebrated in preschools with an activity to which parents are invited. Mother's Day is mainly celebrated by children at kindergartens. There are no longer mutual gifts among members of the family, and there is no longer any commercialization of the celebration. It is now an official holiday.",

In 2005, the International Olympic Committee confirmed that ski orienteering was under consideration for inclusion in the review process of the Olympic sport program for the 2014 Winter Olympic Games.

    "doc2": "Normal functioning of the kidney, brain, liver, heart, and other systems can be affected by uranium exposure, because, besides being weakly radioactive, uranium is a toxic metal. Uranium is also a reproductive toxicant. Radiological effects are generally local because alpha radiation, the primary form of 238U decay, has a very short range, and will not penetrate skin. Alpha radiation from inhaled uranium has been demonstrated to cause lung cancer in exposed nuclear workers. Uranyl () ions, such as from uranium trioxide or uranyl nitrate and other hexavalent uranium compounds, have been shown to cause birth defects and immune system damage in laboratory animals. While the CDC has published one study that no human cancer has been seen as a result of exposure to natural or depleted uranium, exposure to uranium and its decay products, especially radon, are widely known and significant health threats. Exposure to strontium-90 and other fission products is unrelated to uranium exposure (though iodine-131 exposure is related), but may result from medical procedures or exposure to spent reactor fuel or fallout from nuclear weapons.",

The album included \"I Never Talk to Strangers\", a duet with Midler, with whom he was still in an intermittent relationship. She appeared with him at the Troubadour to sing the song; the next day he repaid the favor by performing at a gay rights benefit at the Hollywood Bowl that Midler was involved with. \"Foreign Affairs\" was as well received by critics as its predecessor, and just like \"Small Change\" it managed to make the Billboard Top 100 album chart. That year, he began a relationship with the singer-songwriter Rickie Lee Jones; their work and styles influenced each other. In October 1977, he returned to touring with the Nocturnal Emissions; it was on this tour that he first began using props onstage, in this case a street lamp. Again, he found the tour exhausting.

It was decreed that schools were to be established at cathedral churches and other places to give instruction in sacred and secular literature.

Examples include the leopard's spotted coat, the battledress of a modern soldier, and the leaf-mimic katydid's wings. A third approach, motion dazzle, confuses the observer with a conspicuous pattern, making the object visible but momentarily harder to locate. The majority of camouflage methods aim for crypsis, often through a general resemblance to the background, high contrast disruptive coloration, eliminating shadow, and countershading. In the open ocean, where there is no background, the principal methods of camouflage are transparency, silvering, and countershading, while the ability to produce light is among other things used for counter-illumination on the undersides of cephalopods such as squid. Some animals, such as chameleons and octopuses, are capable of actively changing their skin pattern and colours, whether for camouflage or for signalling.

Under this title, the series finished its run with issue #106 (Oct. 1982). Josie and her gang also made staggered monthly appearances in either \"Pep Comics\" or \"Laugh Comics\" during the 1960s.",

Grissom crater is one of several located on the far side of the Moon named for Apollo astronauts. The name was created and used by the Apollo 8 astronauts in their mission reports and in publications about their work in the scientific press and in news releases. As such, the name was formally adopted as the official name by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 1970. 2161 Grissom is a main belt asteroid that was discovered in 1963 and officially designated in 1981. The name references his launch date of July 21, 1961. \"Grissom Hill\", one of the \"Apollo 1 Hills\" on Mars was named by NASA on January 27, 2004, the 37th anniversary of the Apollo 1 fire.",

A dog wrapped in paper turned up at the door, who had a book that everyone old enough to read took turns silently perusing, in hope of finding clues. Although Simon's parents were unaware of who had sent the dog, they adopted him and Simon called him Chippy. The book was stored in the loft. One day, Simon hears Chippy in the loft. Investigating, Simon finds that the book is titled \"Ye Olde Spellbooke\". Simon throws the book onto the floor in contempt, only for a portal to open above it. Chippy quickly goes through the portal and Simon follows, ending up in another world. After escaping from some goblins who intended to eat Simon, he quickly discovers a house in a village belonging to a wizard called Calypso, along with a note from him. Through it, Simon learns he was brought to this world to save Calypso from the evil sorcerer, Sordid.",

To support his son's racing, Rolf Schumacher took on a second job renting and repairing karts, while his wife worked at the track's canteen. When Michael needed a new engine costing 800 DM, his parents were able to afford it; he was able to continue racing even though he was unable to get support from local businessmen.",

Despite having to completely replace its war fleet, the Navy managed to maintain its overwhelming advantage over all potential rivals. Due to British leadership in the Industrial Revolution, the country enjoyed unparalleled shipbuilding capacity and financial resources, which ensured that no rival could take advantage of these revolutionary changes to negate the British advantage in ship numbers. In 1889, Parliament passed the Naval Defence Act, which formally adopted the 'two-power standard', which stipulated that the Royal Navy should maintain a number of battleships at least equal to the combined strength of the next two largest navies. The end of the 19th century saw structural changes and older vessels were scrapped or placed into reserve, making funds and manpower available for newer ships.

    "doc2": "Between 1815 and 1914, the Navy saw little serious action, owing to the lack of any opponent strong enough to challenge its dominance and leading to an absence in naval developments. During this period, naval warfare underwent a few transformations brought about by steam powered ships. Despite having to completely replace its war fleet, the Navy managed to maintain its overwhelming advantage over all potential rivals. Due to British leadership in the Industrial Revolution, the country enjoyed unparalleled shipbuilding capacity and financial resources, which ensured that no rival could take advantage of these revolutionary changes to negate the British advantage in ship numbers. In 1889, Parliament passed the Naval Defence Act, which formally adopted the 'two-power standard', which stipulated that the Royal Navy should maintain a number of battleships at least equal to the combined strength of the next two largest navies. The end of the 19th century saw structural changes and older vessels were scrapped or placed into reserve, making funds and manpower available for newer ships. The launch of in 1906 rendered all existing battleships obsolete.",

Japanese commuter rail also tends to be heavily interlined with subway lines, with commuter rail trains continuing into the subway network, and then out onto different commuter rail systems on the other side of the city. Many Japanese commuter systems operate several levels of express trains to reduce the travel time to distant locations, often using station bypass tracks in addition to dedicated express tracks.

For instance, Central Americans sometimes refer to their nations as if they were provinces of a Central American state. Central American's practically never write \"C.A.\" after the country's name in formal and informal contexts.

In \"The World\", William Archer wrote that he had enjoyed watching the play but found it to be empty of meaning: \"What can a poor critic do with a play which raises no principle, whether of art or morals, creates its own canons and conventions, and is nothing but an absolutely wilful expression of an irrepressibly witty personality?\"",

On November 9, 1895, John Heisman executed a hidden ball trick utilizing quarterback Reynolds Tichenor to get Auburn's only touchdown in a 6 to 9 loss to Vanderbilt. It was the first game in the south decided by a field goal. Heisman later used the trick against Pop Warner's Georgia team. Warner picked up the trick and later used it at Cornell against Penn State in 1897. He then used it in 1903 at Carlisle against Harvard and garnered national attention.",

After a truce was signed they headed for Bulgaria and walked home. Research of Samuel's grave suggests that the bone in his arm healed at an angle of 140\u00b0 but remained crippled.",
