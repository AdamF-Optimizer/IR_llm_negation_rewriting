After a tragic car accident that leads to the death of a young girl, Ben begins noticing strange blurs in many of his fashion shoot photographs, which Jane suspects is the spirit of the dead girl that they killed. The film stars Joshua Jackson, Rachael Taylor, and Megumi Okina.\n\n\nIt was produced by Regency Enterprises and was released on March 21, 2008. It grossed $10.4 million in its opening weekend and $48.6 million worldwide, against an $8 million budget, making the film a box office success despite having only a 9% approval rating based on 65 votes on Rotten Tomatoes.\nBen Shaw and his new wife Jane leave New York for Tokyo, Japan, where Ben has a job as a photographer. While traveling, Jane hits a girl in the middle of the wilderness. Because of this, they later start to find mysterious lights in their photos. Ben begins to complain of severe shoulder pain, and his friends begin to comment he's looking bent and hunched over, though the doctor he goes to see can find no cause. Ben's assistant takes them to her ex-boyfriend, who says that the lights are spirits, manifestations of intense emotions. They then go to a psychic, Murasame; however, Ben refuses to translate what Murasame says, claiming he is a hack.\n\n\nLater on Jane decides to visit the office building in the photo. When she gets there, she goes to the floor where the light has gathered, and takes pictures in the empty office. She encounters the spirit, and learns that the girl's name was Megumi Tanaka and that Ben knew her. When she confronts Ben about it, he admits that he and Megumi were once involved in a relationship, but that after the death of her father, she became very obsessive and clingy, and eventually dumped her, with help from his two friends. Jane is upset with Ben and decides they need to find Megumi."}], "Something Wild (1961 film)": [{"Films about women in the United States set in New York(state) but not about prostitution": "'''''Something Wild''''' is a 1961 American psychological drama film directed by Jack Garfein, and starring Carroll Baker, Ralph Meeker and Mildred Dunnock.

As well as being a road movie, the film is a coming-of-age film; as the adventure, initially centered on youthful hedonism, unfolds, Guevara discovers himself transformed by his observations on the life of the impoverished indigenous peasantry. Through the characters they encounter on their continental trek, Guevara and Granado witness first hand the injustices that the destitute face and are exposed to people and social classes they would have never encountered otherwise. To their surprise, the road presents to them both a genuine and captivating picture of Latin American identity.

Schaffner with a screenplay by Gore Vidal based on his 1960 play of the same title. Starring Henry Fonda, Cliff Robertson, and Lee Tracy, the film details the seamy political maneuverings behind the nomination of a presidential candidate. The supporting cast features Edie Adams, Margaret Leighton, Ann Sothern, Shelley Berman, Gene Raymond and Kevin McCarthy. Lee Tracy was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance and it was his final film.\nIn May 1964, former Secretary of State William Russell (Henry Fonda) and Senator Joe Cantwell (Cliff Robertson) are the two leading candidates for the presidential nomination of the Democratic Party. Both have potentially fatal vulnerabilities. Russell is a principled intellectual but his sexual indiscretions and lack of attention to his wife Alice (Margaret Leighton) have alienated her. He has a past nervous breakdown to live down. Cantwell portrays himself as a populist \"man of the people\" and patriotic anti-communist campaigning to end \"the missile gap\". He is a ruthless opportunist, willing to go to any lengths to get the nomination. Neither man can stand the other; neither believes his rival qualified to be president. At the nominating convention in Los Angeles, they lobby for the crucial support of dying former President Art Hockstader (Tracy). The pragmatic Hockstader prefers Russell, but worries about his indecision and principles; he despises Cantwell for his recklessness but appreciates his toughness and willingness to do whatever it takes.\n\n\nHockstader decides to support Cantwell until the candidate blunders badly. When the two speak privately, Cantwell attacks Russell using illegally obtained psychological reports obtained by Don Cantwell, his brother and campaign manager. Cantwell mistakenly assumed that Hockstader was going to endorse Russell. The former President tells Cantwell that he does not mind a \"bastard\" but objects to a stupid one. He endorses neither man. The candidates try to sway undecided delegates, Russell appealing to their principles and Cantwell using blackmail. Russell finds out to his chagrin that Hockstader has offered the vice-presidential spot on his ticket to all three of the minor candidates, Senator Oscar Anderson (Richard Arlen), Governor John Merwin (William R. Ebersol) and Governor T.T. Claypoole (John Henry Faulk). One of Russell's aides finds Sheldon Bascomb (Shelley Berman), who served in the military with Cantwell and is willing to link him to homosexual activity while stationed in Alaska during World War II. Hockstader and Russell's closest advisors press Russell to seize the opportunity but he refuses to do so."}], "Mister America": [null], "Opposites Attract (film)": [{"Films set in the Southwestern United States": "A former cowboy movie star Rex Roper (John Forsythe) decides to run for Mayor of Crescent Bay, California.", "about ideologies": "Charlene is also running for Mayor, pitting her solid reputation, vigilant community membership and homespun values against Rex's popularity, megabucks and media savvy."}], "Swing Vote (2008 film)": [{"Films set in the Southwestern United States": "The popular vote is tied for the two major candidates in New Mexico, leaving Bud to decide the next president of the United States.", "about ideologies": "Bud's actual opinions (or lack thereof) are misinterpreted by the media, causing the candidates to flip-flop on several positions (the Democrats take a pro-life and anti-illegal immigration position, while the Republicans take a pro-environmental and pro-gay marriage position)."}]}}}

Despite this announcement back then, it was not confirmed if star Keanu Reeves would return for a new installment. However, he told ''GQ'' that he would carry on the role as long as the audience wanted it, saying, \"As far as my legs can take me, as far as the audience wants to go.\"\n\n\nStahelski later teased the fourth film on an interview with IndieWire by saying Wick would not end the fourth film in \"a happy ending\", saying, \"John may survive all this shit but at the end of it, there's no happy ending.

If you're this fucking guy, if this guy really existed, how is this guy's day going to end? He's fucked for the rest of his life.

That's open for interpretation, you can take it one of two ways, and that's kind of where we pick up some of the unanswered questions in ''John Wick 4''.\" The studio opted to move on from series creator Derek Kolstad and instead hired Shay Hatten to write the script in May 2020.

The film is Araki's eighth, premiering at the 61st Venice International Film Festival in 2004, although it was not more widely distributed until 2005.\n\n\n''Mysterious Skin'' tells the story of two pre-adolescent boys who both experienced a strange event as children, and how it affects their lives in different ways into their young adulthood. One boy becomes a reckless, sexually adventurous prostitute, while the other retreats into a reclusive fantasy of alien abduction.\nTwo eight-year-old Little League teammates, Neil McCormick and Brian Lackey, both experience life-altering events during the summer of 1981 in Hutchinson, Kansas. Neil, the son of an irresponsible single mother and already discovering his own homosexuality, is sexually abused by the Little League coach, who leaves town after that summer. Brian, whose parents are often neglectful or busy working, only remembers that it started to rain during a game. The next thing he remembers is being in the crawl space of his house with a bloody nose, having no memory of the intervening five hours."}], "The Spiderwick Chronicles (film)": [{"2000's dark fantasy films that aren't horror": "'''''The Spiderwick Chronicles''''' is a 2008 American fantasy film based on the book series of the same name by Holly Black and Tony DiTerlizzi."}], "Paprika (2006 film)": [{"2000's dark fantasy films that aren't horror": "a 2006 Japanese animated science fiction psychological thriller film"}], "Monkeybone": [{"2000's dark fantasy films that aren't horror": "'''''Monkeybone''''' is a 2001 American black comedy fantasy film directed by Henry Selick, written by Sam Hamm, produced by Michael Barnathan and Mark Radcliffe, and executive produced by Chris Columbus, Selick, and Hamm.", "that aren't horror": "Stuart \"Stu\" Miley is a disillusioned cartoonist whose comic character, a rascal monkey named Monkeybone, is getting an animated series and numerous merchandise, at the constant pestering of his agent and friend, Herb."}], "A Christmas Carol (2009 film)": [{"2000's dark fantasy films": "'''''A Christmas Carol''''', is a 2009 American computer-animated dark fantasy Christmas film written and directed by Robert Zemeckis."}]}}}

They hear on the radio that a prisoner, Sid Halligan, has escaped from Sing Sing. Steve and Nancy argue: she says he has drunk too much before they left.
